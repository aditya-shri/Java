### Iterative Programs

------

1- Java Program to Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

The positive numbers 1, 2, 3... are known as natural numbers and its sum is the result of all numbers starting from 1 to the given number.

For n, the sum of natural numbers is:
```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
```

2- Java Program to Find Factorial of a Number

The factorial of a positive number n is given by:
```
factorial of n (n!) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n
```

-----

3- Java Program to Generate Multiplication Table

```
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
```

--------

4- Java Program to Display Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci series is a series where the next term is the sum of pervious two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence is 0 followed by 1.
```
The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```
